# TODO load an image

# TODO define a function that computes the intersection point of two lines

# TODO define the mouse callback function that draws lines in the image and
# stores the clicked points

# TODO create a window that is clickable using cv2.setMouseCallback

# TODO implement a loop so that at least for points can be clicked to define
# lines and compute their intersection
